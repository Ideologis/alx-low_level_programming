[200~Bit manipulation
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at Alx Africa. It aims to learn about how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators in C language.

Technologies
C files are compiled using gcc
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

Filename	Description
0-binary_to_uint.c	Converts a binary number to an unsigned int
1-print_binary.c	Prints the binary representation of a number
2-get_bit.c	Returns the value of a bit at a given index
3-set_bit.c	Sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
4-clear_bit.c	Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
5-flip_bits.c	Returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another
100-get_endianess.c	Checks the endianness
101-password	Script that contains the password of crackme3 file
